# Notes

## Overview

This folder contains some notes on different topics that I wrote for informal occasions—some for lectures, others for proposal writing or general reference.[^1]

- `note_axion` – some quick notes on axion cosmology, originally prepared as part of my PhD proposal. 
- `note_inflation` – lecture notes on inflationary cosmology, also prepared for the *[CosmoVerse School @ Corfu](https://cosmoversetensions.eu/event/cosmoverseschoolcorfu/)*. 
- `note_MCMC` – an informal overview of MCMC methods, originally prepared for my lectures on inflationary cosmology at the *[CosmoVerse School @ Corfu](https://cosmoversetensions.eu/event/cosmoverseschoolcorfu/)*.
