- `intro_to_CAMB.ipynb` is a notebook for getting started with [CAMB](https://github.com/cmbant/camb), originally prepared for my lectures on inflationary cosmology at the *[CosmoVerse School @ Corfu](https://cosmoversetensions.eu/event/cosmoverseschoolcorfu/)*. 
- `intro_to_GetDist.ipynb` is a notebook for getting familiar with [GetDist](https://github.com/cmbant/getdist), also from my lectures at the *[CosmoVerse School @ Corfu](https://cosmoversetensions.eu/event/cosmoverseschoolcorfu/)*.
- `intro_to_MCMC.ipynb` is a notebook for exploring MCMC analyses, again from the same set of lectures for the *[CosmoVerse School @ Corfu](https://cosmoversetensions.eu/event/cosmoverseschoolcorfu/)*.
