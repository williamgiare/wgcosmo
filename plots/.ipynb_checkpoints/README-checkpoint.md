# Plots  

## Overview  

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that can serve as a guide for reproducing different types of plots Iâ€™ve used in some of my publications.[^1] If you find this material helpful for making your own plots, feel free to use it at your convenience. In this case, however, I would appreciate it if you could acknowledge my GitHub `wgcosmo`.[^2]  

[^1]: Note that many of these notebooks require specific inputs to work properly. They are shared here primarily as references.  
[^2]: If you notice any typos or issues with the materials shared, please [let me know](mailto:w.giare@sheffield.ac.uk)!
