## Overview

Over recent years, preparing academic and non-academic lectures and presentations has become a significant part of my work. I consider the dissemination of scientific results a crucial aspect of research, complementing hands-on work.

Due to the positive feedback and interest I've received, I've decided to share the materials from my contributions to conferences, workshops, and lectures. I hope these materials will be helpful to the community, especially students and early-career researchers.

Since I often discuss similar topics with distinct audiences or different topics with the same audience, I've accumulated multiple versions of slides, notes, and lectures tailored to specific cases. Rather than simply uploading slides from various conferences, I aim to organize the material on this webpage by topic. This approach will help distill the different versions into a configuration that maximizes the pedagogical value of the slides for those new to a topic while also conveying the results of my research, which may evolve over time.

I will do my best to keep the content on this webpage as up-to-date as possible, with the hope that it will be of interest and use to others. 

If you find this material helpful for your research or presentation, feel free to use it at your convenience. In this case, however, please acknowledge my GitHub `wgcosmo`. [^1]
